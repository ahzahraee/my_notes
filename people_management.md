# Lead with a manager mindset

Your biggest career transition might not be a new title—but a new mindset. The skills that made you a star performer are different from the ones that are most useful when you are endeavoring to become a star manager. 

Let’s explore three common scenarios for new managers that highlight the critical mindset shifts you’ll need for success: focusing on team results, fostering team member growth, and considering the impact of every decision on the team. 

**Shift 1: Prioritize team results**

The Scenario: You’re a talented graphic designer whose stunning layouts have won awards for originality. You’ve been promoted to manager of the design team. On your first day, a well-known luxury brand requests marketing materials for a new campaign. 

Individual Mindset: You can already envision the perfect design. Your instinct is to tell the team, “I’ll take the lead on the campaign design and will assign production tasks to you once my concept is approved by the client.” This is the mindset that made you a strong individual contributor: taking ownership and delivering amazing work yourself.

Manager Mindset: As a manager, however, your role has changed. Your job isn’t to be the best designer in the room, it’s to set the whole design team up for success. You decide to distribute the work saying, "We’ve got an important new client and a fantastic opportunity for our team. I'd like to propose an approach where each designer contributes their unique strengths to different aspects of the campaign." You can feel a wave of surprise, then excitement, ripple through the team.

Mindset Shift: As an individual contributor, your value was in your personal output. As a manager, your value is in the output of your entire team. Transitioning to a manager mindset means you’re prioritizing teamwork and the team's collective results over your own personal ambition. 

**Shift 2: Focus on team members’ career growth**

The Scenario: You’re now managing the same software team you have been a member of for a few years. Your company just announced a new initiative to integrate AI into all products. The next day, a request arrives to integrate AI into a new product feature.  

Individual Mindset: You are focused on assigning the work quickly to check it off your long to-do list. You know a team member has just completed another project and is available to take this on. You assign the project to them confident they’ll get it done but not considering if they’d find it engaging.

Manager Mindset: You think about each person on the team and who might be the best fit for the project based not only on their availability, but also on their skills, interests, and career goals. You recall that a team member, Kenji, was excited about the new initiative and has already been using AI in interesting ways in his existing work. You see the potential for this to be a leadership opportunity for Kenji. You decide to have a conversation with Kenji to gauge his interest.

Mindset Shift: Transitioning to a manager mindset means you’re no longer just assigning tasks to get the work done; you are a leader seeking to find the right person for the right project, aligning their individual interests with company goals.

**Shift 3:  Embrace impactful decision making**

The Scenario: You were one of the top analysts at a leading financial company, and now you manage the team. You are swamped with end-of-year reporting when an important client asks for help with an urgent project: analyzing a huge business deal worth billions of dollars. They say they need a full report and your recommendation on a deadline that seems impossible to meet. 

Individual Mindset: You're a problem-solver who thrives under pressure and enjoys the recognition that comes from saving the day. Your first thought is to accept the project and rally the team, despite knowing it will push them to their limits and may result in poor quality work. You say, "An important client needs support on a big deal. It's going to mean a lot of overtime, but we can do this." This is the can-do attitude that got you promoted.

Manager Mindset: You pause to consider the risks. You recognize that in financial analysis, speed can lead to mistakes. A rushed calculation or an overlooked detail could damage the client relationship and your team's reputation. You decide to consult the team to discuss the opportunity and what they’d need to do the job well. 

Based on the team’s input, you talk with the client and say, "A deal this big requires very careful research. To do it right, we need more time than the current schedule allows. We can provide the most important information now, and then follow up with our complete analysis." The client agrees, giving your team the time required for high-quality work.

Mindset Shift: As an individual contributor, your instinct was to solve the immediate problem. As a manager, your focus is on the broader impact of your decisions, choosing what is best for the team to produce better work overall.

**Key takeaway**

It takes effort to shift your thinking into a manager mindset, but doing so will empower your team and drive meaningful outcomes. 

To start, ask yourself: 

1. What tasks am I holding on to that could create opportunities for other team members? 

2. Whose potential have I not fully unlocked, and what can I do to support their career goals? 

3. In my next decision, how can I better weigh the potential impact on the team?

# Create high performing teams

Fear of failure, of speaking up, or of being blamed for mistakes can prevent a team from sharing its best ideas. Let’s break down three common scenarios and see how a simple shift in your approach can build a truly high-performing team.

**Build strong one-on-one relationships**

Go beyond the status update in your one-on-ones. These meetings are a crucial time to build trust and learn what's challenging and motivating your team—don't waste the opportunity.  

Let's look at an example conversation between a manager and team member.
A basic approach

    Manager: "Let's start with the new project. What's the latest update?"

    Team Member: "I've completed the initial draft and sent it for review. I'm on track to meet the deadline."

    Manager: "Good. Any roadblocks?"

    Team Member: "No, everything is fine."

    Manager: "Okay, great. Keep up the good work."

With this approach, while the manager gets some information they need, they don’t learn anything about the team member’s actual experience, what challenges they might be hesitant to share, or how to better support them. 

Now, let’s look at an approach that invites a deeper conversation.
A better approach

    Manager: “How are you feeling about the upcoming project? I’d love to hear your thoughts on any potential challenges you see coming.”

    Team member: “I’m worried about the tight timeline. I’m not sure if we can meet this deadline.”

    Manager: “That’s a valid concern. I appreciate the heads up. Let’s figure out what we can do to make the timeline feel more manageable.”

 **Why it works**

Demonstrates active listening: The manager invites and acknowledges the team member’s concerns, making them feel heard and valued. This builds the trust necessary for honest communication.

Encourages collaboration: By involving the team member in finding solutions, the manager creates a collaborative environment, helping to build trust. 

**Encourage open communication**

Silence in a meeting is often mistaken for agreement. In reality, silence can signal that the team is uncomfortable sharing different opinions or concerns. When you create an environment where a team is comfortable challenging ideas, it can lead to better solutions and help the team reach its goals.

Let's look at an example conversation. The manager has just presented a new strategy to the team then tries to start a discussion.
A basic approach

    Manager: "Here's the plan for the new campaign. It's based on last quarter's data, and I think it's the best way forward. Any questions?"

(Silence. A few team members nod.)

    Manager: "Great. Let's get started on the action items."

This manager signals that the decision is already made. By asking a closed-ended question like, "Any questions?" they shut down discussion and miss valuable insights.Now, let’s look at a better approach which invites real input.
A better approach

    Manager: "Okay, so we have a starting point for the project. Before we go any further,  I want to hear what everyone thinks. The best ideas come from us poking holes in them first. What are we missing? Where could this go wrong?"

    Team Member: "This might be thinking too far ahead, but I’m a little concerned about how this might affect our long-term goals."

    Manager: "That's a great point, thank you for raising it. Tell me more. That’s exactly the kind of thinking we need to make this strategy solid."

**Why it works**

    Sets an open tone: The manager actively invites different perspectives, framing it as a valuable part of the process. This makes team members more comfortable speaking up.

    Positively reinforces input: By validating the team member's concern, the manager encourages them and the rest of the team to raise issues again in the future.

    Focuses on improvement: The goal shifts from getting quick approval to building the best possible strategy together, leveraging the team's full expertise.

**Create a culture of learning, not blame**

How a team handles failure is a great test of its culture. When managers focus on blame, it creates fear and stifles innovation. Focusing on learning from mistakes, however, encourages open discussion about failures and the kind of risk-taking that can lead to breakthroughs.

Let's look at an example conversation. After the team misses a project deadline, the manager holds a team meeting.
A basic approach

    Manager: “The launch was delayed. I want to go through our entire process, from how it was planned to how we picked the launch date. I want to hear from each of you about your specific goals and what you did. I'm trying to get a clear picture so we can identify the breakdown in the process.”

While the manager claims to be focused on the process, their questions target what each person did, signaling a search to hold someone responsible. Team members are less likely to offer honest insights and more focused on protecting themselves. The opportunity for learning is lost.

Now let’s look at a different approach, where the manager frames missing the project deadline as a chance to improve together.
A better approach

    Manager: "This project didn’t go as planned, but let's make this a learning opportunity. The goal isn’t to place blame, but to improve our process. What can we learn from this experience that will help us on the next project? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts."

    Team Member: "I think we didn’t anticipate the staffing needs correctly. Maybe we need a better forecasting process."

    Manager: "That’s a great observation, thank you for sharing. Can you tell us more? And does anyone else have thoughts on how we might improve our staffing forecast process going forward?"

**Why it works**

    Focuses on collective learning and improvement: Instead of focusing on the mistake, the manager frames the discussion around getting better as a team.

    Removes the fear of mistakes: By explicitly removing blame and thanking the team member for their input, the manager creates an environment where team members feel supported when they talk about mistakes.

**Key takeaways**

Your daily conversations are the most powerful tool you have to build a high-performing team. Shift your one-on-ones from simple status updates to genuine dialogues. In team meetings, don't settle for silence; actively invite dissenting opinions by asking, "What perspectives are we missing?" Finally, re-frame project failures from a search for blame to a quest for learning, asking, "What can we learn from this experience?" By changing your questions, you change the team’s culture. And that is how you build a team that doesn’t just perform—it excels. 

# Use AI to be a more effective manager

When was the last time you had a full hour for uninterrupted strategic thinking? Too often, routine tasks get in the way of impactful management work, like checking in with your team, strategic planning, and your own professional development. AI tools can help, freeing you up to focus on what matters most.

The key to saving time with AI is understanding where it can provide support. AI tools can’t manage a team—that’s your responsibility—but they can help you with a wide range of other tasks like brainstorming, summarizing, and drafting communication. By collaborating with AI to provide a strong first draft of these tasks, you save time on administrative work and free up your mental energy to focus on the truly human aspects of management: strategic thinking, coaching your team, building relationships, and using your experience to make final decisions.

Let's look at a real-world example of this partnership in action.

**Scenario: Planning a team strategy session**

Maria manages a marketing team and needs to plan a critical half-day strategy session for the team to set priorities for next year. She has a high-level strategy and goals, but the specifics aren't fleshed out on how the team will achieve them. She's short on time and starting from scratch.

**A basic approach**

Maria opens a blank document on her computer, titles it “Strategy Session”, and shares it with the team, inviting them to help plan the agenda. After ideas trickle in over the next few days, Maria spends several hours pulling together the session’s objectives, a rough agenda, and pre-reading material. Heading into the strategy session, she feels she wasted valuable time on administrative tasks instead of focusing on the actual strategic outcomes of the session.

Now, let's see how Maria could approach this differently using AI as a partner.

**A better approach**

-   First, Maria asks an AI assistant, like [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), to help her develop a meaningful strategy session using a prompt like:
    
*You are a seasoned marketing strategist. Define 3-4 clear, actionable objectives and a detailed agenda for a half-day team strategy session. We want to translate our high-level strategy into a detailed, tactical plan for the year. Present the objectives as a numbered list, each with a brief rationale explaining its importance to the session. Structure the agenda in three parts: a detailed, timed schedule for the half-day session, a description of each activity, and an explanation of how that activity will help meet the session’s objectives. For reference, here are some ideas … (Maria adds the “Strategy Session” document the team contributed to.)*

Within seconds, she has a list of focused objectives and a tailored agenda that provide a solid foundation for the meeting. Maria then spends a few minutes revising the objectives and agenda, giving them the detail and substance that only she can provide.

-   Then, instead of staring at a blank page to create pre-reading materials, Maria uploads related data and documents to Gemini along with the following prompt:
    

_"Summarize the attached annual performance report, social media analytics, and competitor analysis into a single-page pre-reading document for the team. Identify key themes and propose strategic opportunities for the team to discuss."_

In minutes, the AI assistant produces a draft of the pre-reading material. This saved Maria hours of work and allowed her to use her expertise to quickly finalize the document, ensuring her team would arrive at the session fully prepared.

After spending just a small part of her morning, Maria feels confident in her session plans and is ready to share them with the team.

**Why it's better**

By using AI, Maria went from being an administrator, bogged down by low-value tasks, to a strategist, freed up to focus on the high-value work of leading her team. This shift allowed her to dedicate her time and mental energy to the actual substance and desired outcomes of the session.

 **Unlocking AI: The art of the prompt**

What truly separates the two approaches isn't just the use of AI, but _how_ it's used. The magic in the "better approach" lies in Maria's process: she writes effective prompts and then refines AI’s responses with her own experiences. She isn't just asking a question; she's giving clear, context-rich instructions that guide the AI assistant toward a specific and high-quality output. She then iterates on that result, adding detail and substance based on her expertise.

Learning to craft a good prompt is the key to transforming AI from a simple tool into an effective, collaborative assistant.

 **The five components of an effective prompt**

A great prompt provides all the information the AI needs to succeed. Let's deconstruct Maria's prompt to see these five key ingredients in action.

 **Deconstructing the prompt**

1.  [Persona] _“You are a seasoned marketing strategist.”_
    
2.  [Task] _“Define 3-4 clear, actionable objectives and a detailed agenda for a half-day team strategy session.”_
    
3.  [Context] _“We want to translate our high-level strategy into a detailed, tactical plan for the year.”_
    
4.  [Format] _“Present the objectives as a numbered list, each with a brief rationale explaining its importance to the session. Structure the agenda in three parts: a detailed, timed schedule for the half-day session, a description of each activity, and an explanation of how that activity will help meet the session’s objectives”_
    
5.  [Example] _“For reference, here are initial thoughts from the team…<Maria adds the “Strategy Session” document>.”_
    

 **The prompting framework explained**

1.  **Assign a Persona**: Tell the AI who to be. This sets the tone, perspective, and expertise for the response.
    
2.  **Define the Task**: State exactly what you want the AI to do. Use clear, specific action verbs.
    
3.  **Provide Context**: Explain the "why" behind the task. What is the overall goal? This is crucial for getting relevant results.
    
4.  **Specify the Format**: Tell the AI how to structure the output. Should it be a list, a table, a paragraph, or an email?
    
5.  **Include an Example**: If possible, provide a reference of what you're looking for. This helps the AI understand your quality bar and style.
    

 **The final step: Evaluate and iterate**

AI's output is a starting point, not a final product. Always evaluate the response for accuracy and bias, and then iterate by refining your prompt or editing the output directly. The best results come from a partnership where AI provides the first draft and you provide the final, human touch.

 **Use AI responsibly**

Be thoughtful about the information you input into publicly available AI tools. You never want to share confidential or sensitive information about your company, or personal information about yourself or coworkers. When in doubt, don’t share the information. You can also check if your organization has an enterprise version of an AI tool that is approved for other types of use.

Many organizations have policies for using AI. Check your organization’s policies before using AI and be sure to share that policy with the team.

 **Key takeaways**

When used effectively and responsibly, AI can be a valuable asset. Not only can it help you become more efficient and productive, AI can create more time for strategic thinking and innovation. Take the time to learn how the tools work and remember best practices, like the prompting framework, to get the most value from AI.
