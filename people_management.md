# Lead with a manager mindset

Your biggest career transition might not be a new title—but a new mindset. The skills that made you a star performer are different from the ones that are most useful when you are endeavoring to become a star manager. 

Let’s explore three common scenarios for new managers that highlight the critical mindset shifts you’ll need for success: focusing on team results, fostering team member growth, and considering the impact of every decision on the team. 
Shift 1: Prioritize team results

The Scenario: You’re a talented graphic designer whose stunning layouts have won awards for originality. You’ve been promoted to manager of the design team. On your first day, a well-known luxury brand requests marketing materials for a new campaign. 

Individual Mindset: You can already envision the perfect design. Your instinct is to tell the team, “I’ll take the lead on the campaign design and will assign production tasks to you once my concept is approved by the client.” This is the mindset that made you a strong individual contributor: taking ownership and delivering amazing work yourself.

Manager Mindset: As a manager, however, your role has changed. Your job isn’t to be the best designer in the room, it’s to set the whole design team up for success. You decide to distribute the work saying, "We’ve got an important new client and a fantastic opportunity for our team. I'd like to propose an approach where each designer contributes their unique strengths to different aspects of the campaign." You can feel a wave of surprise, then excitement, ripple through the team.

Mindset Shift: As an individual contributor, your value was in your personal output. As a manager, your value is in the output of your entire team. Transitioning to a manager mindset means you’re prioritizing teamwork and the team's collective results over your own personal ambition. 
Shift 2: Focus on team members’ career growth 

The Scenario: You’re now managing the same software team you have been a member of for a few years. Your company just announced a new initiative to integrate AI into all products. The next day, a request arrives to integrate AI into a new product feature.  

Individual Mindset: You are focused on assigning the work quickly to check it off your long to-do list. You know a team member has just completed another project and is available to take this on. You assign the project to them confident they’ll get it done but not considering if they’d find it engaging.

Manager Mindset: You think about each person on the team and who might be the best fit for the project based not only on their availability, but also on their skills, interests, and career goals. You recall that a team member, Kenji, was excited about the new initiative and has already been using AI in interesting ways in his existing work. You see the potential for this to be a leadership opportunity for Kenji. You decide to have a conversation with Kenji to gauge his interest.

Mindset Shift: Transitioning to a manager mindset means you’re no longer just assigning tasks to get the work done; you are a leader seeking to find the right person for the right project, aligning their individual interests with company goals.
Shift 3:  Embrace impactful decision making

The Scenario: You were one of the top analysts at a leading financial company, and now you manage the team. You are swamped with end-of-year reporting when an important client asks for help with an urgent project: analyzing a huge business deal worth billions of dollars. They say they need a full report and your recommendation on a deadline that seems impossible to meet. 

Individual Mindset: You're a problem-solver who thrives under pressure and enjoys the recognition that comes from saving the day. Your first thought is to accept the project and rally the team, despite knowing it will push them to their limits and may result in poor quality work. You say, "An important client needs support on a big deal. It's going to mean a lot of overtime, but we can do this." This is the can-do attitude that got you promoted.

Manager Mindset: You pause to consider the risks. You recognize that in financial analysis, speed can lead to mistakes. A rushed calculation or an overlooked detail could damage the client relationship and your team's reputation. You decide to consult the team to discuss the opportunity and what they’d need to do the job well. 

Based on the team’s input, you talk with the client and say, "A deal this big requires very careful research. To do it right, we need more time than the current schedule allows. We can provide the most important information now, and then follow up with our complete analysis." The client agrees, giving your team the time required for high-quality work.

Mindset Shift: As an individual contributor, your instinct was to solve the immediate problem. As a manager, your focus is on the broader impact of your decisions, choosing what is best for the team to produce better work overall.
Key takeaway

It takes effort to shift your thinking into a manager mindset, but doing so will empower your team and drive meaningful outcomes. 

To start, ask yourself: 

1. What tasks am I holding on to that could create opportunities for other team members? 

2. Whose potential have I not fully unlocked, and what can I do to support their career goals? 

3. In my next decision, how can I better weigh the potential impact on the team?

## Create high performing teams

Fear of failure, of speaking up, or of being blamed for mistakes can prevent a team from sharing its best ideas. Let’s break down three common scenarios and see how a simple shift in your approach can build a truly high-performing team.
Build strong one-on-one relationships

Go beyond the status update in your one-on-ones. These meetings are a crucial time to build trust and learn what's challenging and motivating your team—don't waste the opportunity.  

Let's look at an example conversation between a manager and team member.
A basic approach

    Manager: "Let's start with the new project. What's the latest update?"

    Team Member: "I've completed the initial draft and sent it for review. I'm on track to meet the deadline."

    Manager: "Good. Any roadblocks?"

    Team Member: "No, everything is fine."

    Manager: "Okay, great. Keep up the good work."

With this approach, while the manager gets some information they need, they don’t learn anything about the team member’s actual experience, what challenges they might be hesitant to share, or how to better support them. 

Now, let’s look at an approach that invites a deeper conversation.
A better approach

    Manager: “How are you feeling about the upcoming project? I’d love to hear your thoughts on any potential challenges you see coming.”

    Team member: “I’m worried about the tight timeline. I’m not sure if we can meet this deadline.”

    Manager: “That’s a valid concern. I appreciate the heads up. Let’s figure out what we can do to make the timeline feel more manageable.”

Why it works

    Demonstrates active listening: The manager invites and acknowledges the team member’s concerns, making them feel heard and valued. This builds the trust necessary for honest communication.

    Encourages collaboration: By involving the team member in finding solutions, the manager creates a collaborative environment, helping to build trust. 

Encourage open communication

Silence in a meeting is often mistaken for agreement. In reality, silence can signal that the team is uncomfortable sharing different opinions or concerns. When you create an environment where a team is comfortable challenging ideas, it can lead to better solutions and help the team reach its goals.

Let's look at an example conversation. The manager has just presented a new strategy to the team then tries to start a discussion.
A basic approach

    Manager: "Here's the plan for the new campaign. It's based on last quarter's data, and I think it's the best way forward. Any questions?"

(Silence. A few team members nod.)

    Manager: "Great. Let's get started on the action items."

This manager signals that the decision is already made. By asking a closed-ended question like, "Any questions?" they shut down discussion and miss valuable insights.Now, let’s look at a better approach which invites real input.
A better approach

    Manager: "Okay, so we have a starting point for the project. Before we go any further,  I want to hear what everyone thinks. The best ideas come from us poking holes in them first. What are we missing? Where could this go wrong?"

    Team Member: "This might be thinking too far ahead, but I’m a little concerned about how this might affect our long-term goals."

    Manager: "That's a great point, thank you for raising it. Tell me more. That’s exactly the kind of thinking we need to make this strategy solid."

Why it works

    Sets an open tone: The manager actively invites different perspectives, framing it as a valuable part of the process. This makes team members more comfortable speaking up.

    Positively reinforces input: By validating the team member's concern, the manager encourages them and the rest of the team to raise issues again in the future.

    Focuses on improvement: The goal shifts from getting quick approval to building the best possible strategy together, leveraging the team's full expertise.

Create a culture of learning, not blame

How a team handles failure is a great test of its culture. When managers focus on blame, it creates fear and stifles innovation. Focusing on learning from mistakes, however, encourages open discussion about failures and the kind of risk-taking that can lead to breakthroughs.

Let's look at an example conversation. After the team misses a project deadline, the manager holds a team meeting.
A basic approach

    Manager: “The launch was delayed. I want to go through our entire process, from how it was planned to how we picked the launch date. I want to hear from each of you about your specific goals and what you did. I'm trying to get a clear picture so we can identify the breakdown in the process.”

While the manager claims to be focused on the process, their questions target what each person did, signaling a search to hold someone responsible. Team members are less likely to offer honest insights and more focused on protecting themselves. The opportunity for learning is lost.

Now let’s look at a different approach, where the manager frames missing the project deadline as a chance to improve together.
A better approach

    Manager: "This project didn’t go as planned, but let's make this a learning opportunity. The goal isn’t to place blame, but to improve our process. What can we learn from this experience that will help us on the next project? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts."

    Team Member: "I think we didn’t anticipate the staffing needs correctly. Maybe we need a better forecasting process."

    Manager: "That’s a great observation, thank you for sharing. Can you tell us more? And does anyone else have thoughts on how we might improve our staffing forecast process going forward?"

Why it works

    Focuses on collective learning and improvement: Instead of focusing on the mistake, the manager frames the discussion around getting better as a team.

    Removes the fear of mistakes: By explicitly removing blame and thanking the team member for their input, the manager creates an environment where team members feel supported when they talk about mistakes.

Key takeaways

Your daily conversations are the most powerful tool you have to build a high-performing team. Shift your one-on-ones from simple status updates to genuine dialogues. In team meetings, don't settle for silence; actively invite dissenting opinions by asking, "What perspectives are we missing?" Finally, re-frame project failures from a search for blame to a quest for learning, asking, "What can we learn from this experience?" By changing your questions, you change the team’s culture. And that is how you build a team that doesn’t just perform—it excels.
